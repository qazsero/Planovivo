# Authentication (choose ONE method):
#
# Method 1 - Local Development:
#   Run: gcloud auth application-default login
#   (No GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var needed)
#
# Method 2 - CI/CD with Service Account File Path:
#   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json
#
# Method 3 - CI/CD with Base64-Encoded Secret (Recommended for key vaults):
#   Encode: cat service-account-key.json | base64
#   Then set: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<base64-string>
#   The code will auto-detect base64 and decode it to a temp file
